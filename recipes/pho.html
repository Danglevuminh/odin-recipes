        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Vietnamese Pho Soup is a tea-like, beef based soup with a flavor profile that differentiates it from the traditional Western palette. 
            This recipe is designed to be as easy to make as possible, and contains the type of meat all too familiar to a Western dinner night meal: beef.
